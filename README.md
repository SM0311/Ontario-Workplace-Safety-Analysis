## Ontario Workplace Safety Analysis and Dashboard

Comprehensive Analysis and Visualization of Workplace Incidents in Ontario

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing workplace safety incidents across Ontario, leveraging Power BI, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), and SQL to provide key insights into incident trends, industry risks, and worker safety compliance. The analysis aids in identifying high-risk industries, accident trends, and demographic insights, supporting data-driven decision-making for workplace safety improvements.

## Objectives

1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, correlations, and risk factors in workplace accidents.
2. Develop interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize key KPIs, industry-specific safety risks, and compliance metrics.
3. Identify high-risk occupations and sectors using data-driven insights to enhance safety policies.
4. Implement predictive analytics for accident frequency, enabling proactive risk management.
5. Ensure data governance and regulatory compliance for workplace safety standards.

## Tools & Technologies

1. Data Processing & Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2. Data Visualization & Reporting: Power BI, SQL (T-SQL, DAX, M Query)
3. Predictive Analytics: Time-Series Forecasting (ARIMA, SARIMA), A/B Testing
4. Data Governance & Compliance: KPI Reporting, Government Compliance Metrics

## Key Insights & Findings

#### High-Risk Industries & Regions:

1. Industrial & Construction sectors had the highest accident occurrences, with Manufacturing and Transportation following closely.
2. Markham, Toronto, and Brampton reported the most workplace incidents, requiring immediate intervention.

#### Demographic Trends in Workplace Safety:

1. Workers aged 55-65 with intermediate experience levels had the highest accident rates.
2. Fall-related accidents were the leading cause of injuries across sectors.

#### Seasonality & Time Trends:

1. Winter and Fall saw an increase in accident rates, emphasizing the need for seasonal workplace safety measures.
2. Workplace incidents have been rising since 2020, demanding better regulatory measures.

#### Predictive Modeling for Risk Prevention:

1. Time-Series Forecasting (ARIMA, SARIMA) models predicted a 15% increase in reported incidents over the next three years.
2. Data-driven safety recommendations were generated to reduce risk exposure and enhance compliance reporting.

#### Power BI Dashboard Features
1. Real-time accident monitoring using interactive filters for industry, region, and workforce size.
2. Geospatial analysis of workplace incidents using map visualizations.
Industry-wise risk breakdown & incident trends, helping decision-makers allocate resources effectively.
Incident forecasting models embedded within Power BI for proactive safety measures.
